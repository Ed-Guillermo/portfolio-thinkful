  <h2>Background</h2>
<article class="history">
<p>My programming interest began in high school where
   I was part of a robotics teams that won over 5 competitions.
   I then decided to learn some Web Development on my own to see if
   I would enjoy it. After a few projects, and a few algorithms solved,
   I ended up falling it love with Web Development.
